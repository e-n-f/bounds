bounds
======

Bounding boxes I have used for a lot of maps.

More for the sake of documentation than as a recommendation for what
anybody else should be doing.


The "flickr-picasa" files specify a series of 15-mile squares based on
clusters of photos separated by gaps of less than 200 feet.
These are the ones I used for the "Geotaggers' World Atlas" and
"Locals and Tourists" sets.

The "twitter" files, similarly, specify a series of 20-mile squares
based on clusters of tweets separated by gaps of less than 200 feet.
These are the ones I used for the "See Something or Say Something"
and "Paths Throughâ€¦" sets and many other miscellaneous maps.

The place names in these files come from finding the smallest bounding
box in the "flickr-localities" file that contains the center of gravity
of the cluster.  That file, meanwhile, is simplified from
flickr_shapefiles_public_dataset_1.0.1.xml.gz, as released in
http://code.flickr.net/2009/05/21/flickr-shapefiles-public-dataset-10/

The "misc" files specify other areas that I have needed to make images
for for one reason or another.
