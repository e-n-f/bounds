These are bounding boxes and centers for each of the city clusters.

The first line is the latitudes and longitudes of the bounding box.

The second line is the center of gravity of the central cluster.

The third line is an approximate place name from the Yahoo
place database.  It is from simple bounding box comparison, not
lookup of a particular point, so it may be a little off.
